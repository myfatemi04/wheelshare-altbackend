Inspiration:
TJ is a magnet school which attracts over 1600 students from counties across Northern Virginia.
Because students are spread out - some living over two hours away - transportation for after-school
activities and sports is a difficult puzzle to solve. We wanted to develop an app that would help
parents and students save time, reduce traffic, and use energy efficiently. 

How it works:
1) You're invited to a group by someone you trust in real life.
2) You see an event: an after-school football game at TJ.
3) You click "I'm interested!"
4) You see other people who are interested and aren't already in a carpool.
   WheelShare calculates how much extra distance it would add to the commute
   to pick each of them up.
5) You see that one of your friends lives on the route to the event, and
   it would only add a minute to your travel time to pick them up.
6) You invite them to carpool with you. If they accept, you're be ready to go!

You can send direct messages through the app, and all carpools automatically have
a group chat created for them.

You can invite people to a carpool regardless of if they can drive themselves or not.
However, if they don't already have a confirmed ride, they'll be bumped to the top of
the list.
